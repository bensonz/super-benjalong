welcome to our 2014 cmu hackathon respository!
It's Benson, Jason and Leo (long)!

In this hackathon we will be building an IOS based application named : EventWizard

What this application will do is allow users to connect with their friends who share the same events. This greatly simplifies your way of living!

Build suggestions:
NONE yet cuz it's not done.

Enviroment suggestion:
NONE yet cuz it's not done.

Thanks!
